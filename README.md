# Face-ID-with-liveness-detection
Trying to make something like Apple Iphone's Face ID, but with free technologies and accessible for everyone. 
This will be a free and secure way to add authentication to your own service.

# NEW FEATURE 
WEB FACE ID on this branch, you can add it to your nodejs project.
# How to launch it
I have made a requirements.txt file for you. It will make it easier to download the necessary packages.
Start the file SetupFacialRecognition.py. When the file is terminated, start the file FaceID.py. You will need two videos, a fake and a real one. The program will automatically show you in which folder to put the files.
The second release is an improvement of the first one with a database attached to the Python script to make it more secure, when starting liveness verification.

# Credits
Thanks to xames3 and pyimagesearch for the repositories.
