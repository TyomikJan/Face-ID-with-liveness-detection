# Face-ID-with-liveness-detection
Trying to make something like Apple Iphone's Face ID, but with free technologies and accessible for everyone. 
This will be a free and secure way to add authentication to your own service.
# How to launch it
Start the file SetupFacialRecognition.py. When the file is terminated, start the file FaceID.py. You will need two videos, a fake and a real one. The program will automatically show you in which folder to put the files.
# Credits
Thanks to xames3 and pyimagesearch for the repositories.
### We need some help to make it more comfortable, so it would be great if you collaborate
